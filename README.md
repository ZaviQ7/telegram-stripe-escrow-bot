# Telegram Escrow Payment Bot

This is a full-featured Telegram bot and web backend for secure peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, milestone-based project escrow, and one-time trades, powered by Stripe Connect. The system supports advanced workflows: milestone deals, automated edge-case handling (offer expiration, auto-release, auto-refund), disputes with admin resolution, and a web-based admin dashboard.

## **1. Prerequisites**

- Python 3.10+
- A Stripe account ([get API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys))
- Telegram bot token ([@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- A server (or local machine for dev) **with a public HTTPS endpoint** (required for Stripe webhooks; use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local testing)
- Git (optional, for version control)

---

## **2. Installation & Setup**

### **A. Extract the ZIP**

Unzip the archive:
```bash
unzip telegram_stripe_bot_final.zip
cd telegram-stripe-bot
```

### **B. Python Environment**

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **C. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **D. Configure Environment Variables**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out your credentials:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...   # Use your Stripe TEST key for dev
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Set this after creating your webhook endpoint in Stripe
BASE_URL=https://your-public-url.com  # MUST be public, e.g. your ngrok or production URL
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///bot.db   # Or your Postgres/MySQL URI
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=123456789         # Your Telegram user ID
PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=2.5        # Platform fee (as percent, optional)
ADMIN_USER=admin                # Web dashboard login
ADMIN_PASS=your_secure_password # Web dashboard password
```

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** To get your Stripe webhook secret, set up a webhook in your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) pointing to `https://your-public-url.com/stripe/webhook`, trigger a payment, and copy the secret from Stripe.

---

## **3. Running the Application**

### **A. Start the Bot and Web Server**

```bash
python main.py
```

- This will start **both** the Telegram bot (polling for messages) and a Flask web server.
- The web server exposes:
  - Stripe webhook at `/stripe/webhook`
  - Static success/cancel pages for Stripe
  - Admin dashboard at `/admin` (HTTP Basic Auth)

### **B. (Optional) Running with Ngrok for Local Testing**

If running locally, expose your Flask server to the public internet:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```
Copy the HTTPS URL and use it as your `BASE_URL` in `.env`.

---

## **4. Stripe Setup Steps**

1. **Create a [Stripe Connect Express](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect) platform.**
2. Add your test API keys to `.env`.
3. Add a webhook in the Stripe dashboard for your `BASE_URL/stripe/webhook`.
   - Listen for at least: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Instruct users (contractors/sellers) to connect their Stripe account via the bot's main menu or the `/connect` command.

---

## **5. Telegram Bot Usage**

The bot is primarily driven by inline buttons.

- **Start:** Send `/start` to the bot to see the main menu.
- **Create a Deal:**
    - From the main menu, choose **"Start One-Time Trade"** or **"Start Milestone Project"**.
    - The bot will ask you to **reply to a message** from the other person (the buyer or contractor) to identify them.
    - Follow the bot's prompts to set a title, amount, and (for projects) add milestones one by one.
- **Manage a Deal:**
    - **Fund:** The client/buyer clicks the "Deposit" or "Pay" button to fund the escrow via Stripe.
    - **Release:** The client/buyer clicks "Release" for a milestone or "Confirm Delivery" for a trade to release funds to the other party.
    - **Dispute:** Either party can click "Raise Dispute" on a funded deal. The bot will guide them through providing a reason and photo proof, which notifies an admin.
- **User Commands:**
    - `/profile [@username]`: View your own or another user's reputation, stats, and reviews.
    - `/connect`: An alias for connecting a Stripe account.

- **Admin Commands:**
    - `/admin_verify @username`: Grants a user "Verified" status.
    - `/admin_unverify @username`: Revokes "Verified" status.
    - `/admin_split [deal_id] [amount_to_seller]`: Resolves a dispute by splitting the funds.
    - `/admin_refund [milestone_id] [reason]`: Issues a full refund for a milestone.
    - `/admin_resolve [deal_id]`: Manually marks a dispute as resolved and unlocks the deal.

---

## **6. Admin Dashboard**

- Access at: `http(s)://<BASE_URL>/admin`
- Login with credentials set in `.env`
- View/manage all Users, Deals, Reviews, Disputes, and Referrals.

---

## **7. Scheduled Automation**

- **Offer Expiration:** Unfunded trade offers are auto-cancelled after 24h.
- **Auto-Refund:** If a seller doesn't ship within 7 days, the buyer is auto-refunded.
- **Auto-Release:** If a buyer doesn't confirm delivery in 7 days, funds auto-release to the seller.
- **All scheduler logic is managed via `scheduler.py` and APScheduler.**

---

## **8. Customization/Deployment Notes**

- Can swap out `sqlite` for Postgres/MySQL in `DATABASE_URL`.
- Use a production WSGI server (Waitress, Gunicorn) for deployment.
- SSL/HTTPS is **mandatory** for Stripe webhooks.
- Consider extra authentication for `/admin` if deploying publicly.

---

## **9. Security & Compliance**

- Platform fees are supported via `PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT`.
- All payments go through Stripe; sensitive data is not stored.
- Admins can split funds, issue refunds, or resolve disputes via bot commands or the web panel.
- Make sure you comply with all legal requirements in your region for holding and releasing funds!
